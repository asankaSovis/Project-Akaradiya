                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>
                  We're a team of Electronic Engineering undergraduate students working on building a web application for the Software Application module. Our goal was to develop a web based system that is both useful and upto standard with the current world. Thus we found Team Blizzard that is intending to build a web application that will achieve these goals.

            <p>
              In order to achieve our goals, we came up with the Project Akaradiya, an opensource dictionary platform that can use crowdsourcing to build a better and more reliable dictionary. We use the strengths of each member to efficiently manage the workflow and build an app that is useful and enjoyable for users to interact with.
