<!-- This is the root Home webpage.
This website loads when the user enters the root, or click on a link to homepage in any other page.
Note: This website is NOT a website to be shown to the user. It merely redirects to the /home
directory where the actual homepage exist. If a user has auto redirects disabled, this website
has no choice but to show itself. So add a link to /home. But otherwise this page MUST
redirect to homepage. -->
