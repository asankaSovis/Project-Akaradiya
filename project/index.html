                <h1>About Project</h1>
                <p>We can observe that a lot of offline dictionaries exist in our usage, most are in printed type. They can be referred to physically but, in most cases, they provide only one definition or meaning to words. We know that Madhura, Derana, Malalasekara are few examples for Sinhala dictionaries, both online and offline that most Sri Lankans use.
                    Madura contains over 230,000 definitions with the facility to translate from English to Sinhala and vice versa. Nowadays, the android app and Madura software are available to the public.
              <a href="www.Dict.lk">Dict.lk</a> is also a famous website that provides an online Sinhala dictionary. It provides abbreviation, glossary, technical terms in the alphabetic order. It is one of the fastest and most effective searchable dictionaries for the Sinhala language.
                    When we talk about the open dictionaries Wikipedia, Macmillan, Urban, Wiktionary and Cambridge are some of the most famous open dictionaries in the world. They are most trusted and well reputed, and have British and American English words with definitions, pictures etc. They operate in the concept of allowing anyone to submit a new word and the best and latest proposals get to make it to the public. They are more convenient as they are more portable and flexible compared to the printed and closed dictionaries.
                    On the other hand, we identify those open dictionaries have the potential to grow while getting better and more accurate in the long term. Wikipedia is the best example. The open dictionaries can also influence the creation of new words and publicize the use of them.
                    Our goal is to introduce the advantages of the open dictionary concept to the Sinhala language. Through this, we plan to create a much broader and diverse collection of definitions to the community.
                    Even though currently, our plan lies in an English to Sinhala language dictionary, it has the potential to expand into a much broader scope of Sinhala to English and Sinhala dictionary as well.</p>
